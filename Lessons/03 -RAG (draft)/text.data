1. Take a list of separators, in order of importance. By default these are:
a. The paragraph separator: \n\n
b. The line separator: \n
c. The word separator: space character
2. To respect the given chunk size, for instance, 1,000 characters, start by splitting
up paragraphs.
3. For any paragraph longer than the desired chunk size, split by the next separator:
lines. Continue until all chunks are smaller than the desired length, or there are
no additional separators to try.
4. Emit each chunk as a Document, with the metadata of the original document
passed in and additional information about the position in the original
document.
