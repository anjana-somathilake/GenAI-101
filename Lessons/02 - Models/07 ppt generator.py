        - Descriptions should be clear and to the point.
        - Descriptions should not use words like "This slide", "This presentation".
        - If **body** contains items, *choose number of items randomly between mentioned constraints.*
        - **Icon queries** must be a generic **single word noun**.
        - Provide 3 icon query for each icon where,
            - First one should be specific like "Led bulb".
            - Second one should be more generic that first like "bulb".
            - Third one should be simplest like "light".
